An interesting application for keeping records of students / teachers / courses.

The application has 3 main screens - "Students", "Courses", "Teachers".

#### STUDENTS screen:

This screen shows a list of all students who exist in our database. If you open an existing student, then all his information is shown, and the courses for which he is signed. There is a "+" button that opens a new window for creating the student.

#### COURSE screen:

This screen shows a list of all courses who exist in our database. If you open an existing course, then all his information is shown, and students who are subscribed to this course. And also the teacher who leads this course. All data can be easily changed (teachers, add or delete students, name of courses and so on). Similarly, courses - you can delete and create new ones. If you delete the course, the students and the teacher will stay in the database.

(And also when choosing students - you can select several, and the teacher - only 1)

#### Teachers screen:

The screen "Teachers" in accuracy is similar to the screen "Students", only adapted for teachers.
